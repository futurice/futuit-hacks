coppermine-gallery-exporter
---------------------------
[coppermine-gallery-exporter](coppermine-gallery-exporter) - A small python script for exporting
[Coppermine Photo Gallery](https://github.com/coppermine-gallery) to a filesystem directory structure

Exchange flatfile importer to LDAP
----------------------------------

[LCI](LCI/) - contains python scripts used to import the exchange flatfiles to LDAP.

It uses direct LDAP access and is fairly tailored to our LDAP schema, so it will
probably not work for you out of the box.

Perhaps it can still be of use to someone, somewhere.
