# coppermine-gallery-exporter

### A small python script to export Coppermine Photo Gallery pictures to a directory structure

We decided to move away from [Coppermine Photo Gallery](https://github.com/coppermine-gallery) and
put the images into Google Drive.

This quick tool was used to read the MySQL db and copy the files to a conventional file structure.

Edit the file to work with your DB credentials, coppermine installation location as instructed
in the source.
